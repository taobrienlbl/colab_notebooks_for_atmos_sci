    "# Observed Baroclinic Waves\n",
    "This [Notebook](https://jupyterlab.readthedocs.io/en/stable/user/notebook.html) aids in exploring the structure of [Rossby waves](https://oceanservice.noaa.gov/facts/rossby-wave.html) in real observational data (specifically, [the NCEP/NCAR Reanalysis I](https://psl.noaa.gov/data/gridded/data.ncep.reanalysis.html))\n",
    "\n",
    "**Objective**:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Describe the horizontal and vertical structure of real baroclinic Rossby waves\n",
    "\n",
    "**Instructions**:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Run the code in Cells 1, 2, 3, and 4.  Cell 4 should generate a map if successful.\n",
    "2. Choose a different date than shown in Cell 3; find a good example of a Rossby wave (you may have to run cells 3 and 4 several times to find a good date)\n",
    "3. Uncomment the indicated line in Cell 3 to download all the variables, and re-run Cell 3 (it'll take several minutes)\n",
    "4. Run cells 4 and 5\n",
    "5. Examine the transect and comment on the structure.  If this is part of an in-class exercise, complete the exercise.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that cells 1 and 3 may take a minute or two to run (especially once Cell 3 has been modified to download multiple datasets).\n",
    "\n",
    "## A note on 'notebooks'\n",
    "One thing to point out is that there are two types of text in the cells below: comment text and code text.  Comment text doesn't actually do anything--it's just meant to help a reader understand the code.  Comment text shows up as one of two things:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\"\"\" This is a comment in triple-quotes.  I often use this to say what the cell is meant to do. \"\"\"\n",
    "\n",
    "# this is a traditional comment; anything that comes after the # symbol on a given line counts as a comment\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**NOTE:** when you want to \"run\" the code in any of the cells below, click on the cell and then press the \"play\" button in the toolbar above...or press Shift+Enter on your keyboard."
